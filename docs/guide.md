# Guide

This guide should get you going with EventEmitter. Once finished you may wish to learn more about the script and use methods that are not shown here. At that point you should either browse [the API documentation](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter/blob/master/docs/api.md) or have a look around [the source](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter/blob/master/EventEmitter.js).
